          In August and September of 2020 California, Oregon, and Washington experienced some of the worst wildfires in the last 70 years. With more than 3 million hectares burned, these wildfires have taken the lives of more than 40 people, destroyed more than 14,000 structures, and will cost the economies of these states billions of dollars.

          Individuals, families, even small-town municipal agencies affected by these wildfires have turned to the popular website GoFundMe to raise money to begin the process of rebuilding and reclaiming what was lost. Despite having this incredible platform, we noticed that some of the individual funds are struggling to reach their goal. Many people donate to funds they have a connection with. They recieve an email, text message, or see those in need through social media and go straight to a specific fund. However, given the unprecedented scale of these fires many individuals in the US and abroad just want to help out in any way possible, but don't have a direct connection to an individual fund. That's where our team at Funding Relief wants help out.
